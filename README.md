# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

Welcome to my Applied Data Science Capstone In the different files published in this repository you will find the different projects that made up this capstone, presented in the Jupyter Notebooks Environment. Each of the files is located in one of the stages of the lifecycle data science, and they are aimed at representing the use of the different techniques and tools useful in this lifecycle. 

In This proyect the objective is to develop a model to predict the success of the landing of the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. In doing this project, I put myself in the role of a data scientist for an aerospace company competing against SpaceX. SpaceX is the most competent company in the rocket business, claiming that its launches cost a fraction of its competitors. This is due to its ability to recover valuable parts from the rockets it manufactures. In this way, instead of building a rocket per launch, it reuses rockets from previous launches, saving millions of dollars. 

SpaceX's success could be estimated in its ability to recover parts, such as the first stage of Falcon 9.
